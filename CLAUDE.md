# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single-file Processing (Java mode) sketch that generates **multi-scale Truchet
tilings** in the style of Christopher Carlson. The entire program is
`Multiscale_Truchet.pde`. There is no build system, package manager, or test
suite — it is a creative-coding sketch.

## Running

There is no CLI here by default; Processing is the runtime. Processing 4.5.2 **is
installed in this WSL environment** (`/opt/processing`, with `processing` and
`processing-java` on the PATH via `/usr/local/bin`). WSLg provides the display
(`DISPLAY=:0`), so GUI windows render. The repo path `/mnt/e/Multiscale_Truchet`
is a WSL mount of a Windows drive.

- **IDE:** `processing` (launches the Processing IDE), or open
  `Multiscale_Truchet.pde` in the Processing IDE on the Windows host and press Run.
- **Headless / command line:**
  `processing-java --sketch=/mnt/e/Multiscale_Truchet --run`
  - Use an **absolute** `--sketch` path. This build does *not* accept the relative
    `--sketch=.` (it then looks for `..pde` and fails with "Not a valid sketch
    folder"). From inside the project folder, `--sketch="$PWD"` works.
  - `--build` compiles only (no window); `--run` opens a window and renders.

The Processing sketch folder name must match the `.pde` filename, so the main
sketch must stay named `Multiscale_Truchet.pde` at the repo root.

Running opens **three windows**: the visualization, a **Controls** panel, and a
**Tiles** panel (per-shape archetype weights) — see "Multi-window architecture"
below. Most parameters are adjustable live from the panels; the keyboard still
works on the visualization window: **SPACE** = new seed, **4/3/6/t** =
square/triangle/hexagon/trapezoid, **P/p** = prev/next palette, **R** = rotate palette,
**C** = colour scheme, **M** = symmetry (none/vertical/horizontal/quad/rot 180/
tile mir V/H/quad), **e** = toggle 3D extrusion, **E** = cycle extrude mode
(oblique/1-point), **a** = toggle animation, **g** = toggle base-grid overlay,
**S** = save `truchet-####.png`.

**Symmetry** (`symmetryMode`) comes in two mechanisms, deliberately different:

- **Pixel mirrors** (modes 1–3, `applySymmetry()` in the main tab) are a
  post-render pixel reflection, applied in `draw()` after the tiles and before
  the save: the strip between the axis and the near border is `get()` and drawn
  back flipped onto the far side. The axis snaps to the grid's mirror line at or
  past the canvas centre (`symPitchX`/`symPitchY`: square = grid lines; triangle
  = side/2 columns and row lines; hexagon = hexW/2 columns and row-centre
  lines), so the seam follows tile geometry and — because the reflected copy
  equals the original along the axis — is seamless for every shape and colour
  scheme. Cheap and works for both axes at once (quad), but the copied half's
  drop shadows point the mirrored way.
- **Tile-level modes** (4 = rot 180; 5/6/7 = tile mirror V/H/quad) are
  structural: `draw()` generates only the fundamental domain (half or quadrant)
  of roots and adds a transformed twin per leaf, then everything renders in one
  normal pass — wings spill across the join both ways, layering holds, shadows
  keep one light direction, and gradients stay continuous; no pixel seam exists.
  (A pixel-copy rot 180 was tried first and rejected: a rotated copy does not
  match the original pointwise along the seam, leaving orphaned wing-disc halves
  and a hard shadow cut.) Each leaf's motif (`Tile.mi`/`mk`) is fixed in
  `collectTile()` rather than rolled at draw time so twins can reuse it.
  - **Rot 180** (mode 4): a half-turn twin is just `rot + PI` with the same
    motif. The centre must be a **2-fold rotation centre of the grid**:
    squares/triangles use `(width/2, grid/row line ≥ height/2)`; hexagons
    rotate about a slanted-edge midpoint (`width/2 + hexW/4`, half-row line —
    `rotCentreX/Y`), which maps hex row r → row 2·rs+1−r with the stagger
    parity working out.
  - **Tile mirrors** (modes 5 V / 6 H / 7 quad): a mirrored motif is drawn by
    reversing the tile's vertex winding (`Tile.flip`, handled in `TileGeom`),
    so no per-shape edge-relabelling tables are needed. The twins are
    `(2·ax−cx, cy, PI−rot, flip)` for V, `(cx, 2·ay−cy, −rot, flip)` for H, and
    `(2·ax−cx, 2·ay−cy, rot+PI, no-flip)` for the quad diagonal (= a
    180-rotation, two reflections, so no winding flip). **Tile-level twinning
    needs no *global* grid mirror line** — the reflected half is self-consistent
    by construction, so only the seam matters: the axis may run along tile
    edges/vertices or through tile centres, never cutting a body off-centre.
    The vertical axis is `width/2` (the grid divides width exactly → a mirror
    column of all three grids). The horizontal axis `mirrorAxisY()` snaps to the
    nearest grid mirror line to mid-canvas (height is *not* divided evenly, so
    it sits slightly off-centre): square `s0/2` line, triangle strip boundary
    (`rowH` spacing — no straddlers; the up-triangle bases there tile
    edge-to-edge and their flipped twins share those exact edges), or hexagon
    row-centre line. A **straddler** (tile centred on an axis: odd-grid square
    columns, one triangle per V-strip, every other hex row, etc.) is its own
    mirror, so `collectSym()` recurses straddlers mirror-aware (far-side
    children dropped — a twin covers them — and on-axis children kept) and
    straddler leaves roll a **self-symmetric motif** (`pickSymmetricMotifMulti`
    + `selfMirrorMotif`: keep the (mi, mk) pairs whose connection set maps onto
    itself under the edge reflection `e → c0−1−e`, with `c0` per axis — vertical
    `(PI−2·rot)/(2π/n)`, horizontal `−2·rot/(2π/n)` — and for quad straddlers,
    symmetric about *both*; weighted as the normal roll conditioned on
    symmetry). `addSymTwins()` emits the orbit (≤3 twins; an axis the tile
    straddles fixes it, collapsing the diagonal onto the surviving reflection).
    NB: because the H axis is off-centre, verifying H symmetry by pixel-diffing
    against an *integer*-rounded reflected coordinate massively inflates the
    mismatch on horizontal-ish edges (≈7%); reflect with the exact float axis
    (e.g. PIL `AFFINE` + bicubic) and it drops to ≈0 — the symmetry is exact.

A 4-fold (90°) mode is geometrically impossible on the non-square canvas
(rotated sources fall off-canvas; tile twins would need a square-symmetric
domain), so it is intentionally absent.

### Verifying changes

**Never screenshot the windows** (scrot/xdotool are unreliable under WSLg and
the user has forbidden it) — make the sketch render the image itself. A one-shot
headless mode exists for exactly this (parsed in `setup()`, saved at the end of
`draw()`):

```sh
TRUCHET_OUT=/tmp/out.png TRUCHET_SHAPE=2 TRUCHET_SEED=7 \
  processing-java --sketch=/mnt/e/Multiscale_Truchet --run
```

renders one frame to `TRUCHET_OUT` and exits, skipping the GUI windows.
**Resolution.** The canvas defaults to 1920×1080 but the tiling is fully
resolution-independent (every length derives from `width`/`height`), so a larger
canvas gives the SAME composition at higher resolution — a print/wallpaper export.
Set size in `settings()` via `TRUCHET_W`/`TRUCHET_H` (explicit pixels) or
`TRUCHET_SCALE` (multiply the default — `2` → 4K 3840×2160, `4` → 8K). These also
enlarge the interactive window (window == canvas in Processing); for a "small
window, big PNG" export use the headless path (`TRUCHET_OUT`), which opens no
window. Big sizes cost memory (the shadow/extrude `BufferedImage` layers are
`width*height*4` bytes each, ~133 MB apiece at 8K). Example:
`TRUCHET_SCALE=2 TRUCHET_OUT=/tmp/4k.png processing-java --sketch=… --run`.
Optional overrides: `TRUCHET_SHAPE` (0 square, 1 triangle, 2 hexagon, 3 trapezoid),
`TRUCHET_SCHEME` (0–4), `TRUCHET_SEED`, `TRUCHET_PALETTE` (index, wraps),
`TRUCHET_SYM` (0–7),
`TRUCHET_SHOWGRID` (0/1 = overlay the base root-tile lattice on top of the render;
re-derived from `buildRoots()` so it covers the whole canvas in every symmetry
mode — see `drawGridOverlay`), `TRUCHET_GRID`, `TRUCHET_DEPTH` (0 = single scale), `TRUCHET_SUBDIV` (subdivide
probability 0–1; `1` = uniform finest scale, handy for isolating subdivision
behaviour from coarse/fine mixing), `TRUCHET_SHADOW` (0/1),
`TRUCHET_SHADOW_STR` (darkness 0–1), `TRUCHET_SHADOW_SIZE` (offset, fraction of
the band stroke; unclamped here for exaggerated tests), `TRUCHET_SHADOW_GLOBAL`
(0 = per-level mask, 1 = one full-scene mask), `TRUCHET_INVERT` (0/1 = duotone
per-level colour inversion; off makes one hue always foreground — handy when a
shadow on an inverted-level *background* reads as if the background were
casting), `TRUCHET_EXTRUDE` (0/1 = 3D extrusion), `TRUCHET_EXTRUDE_MODE`
(0 oblique, 1 one-point), `TRUCHET_VPX`/`TRUCHET_VPY` (vanishing point,
normalised canvas coords, may be off-canvas), `TRUCHET_EXTRUDE_DEPTH` (fraction
of tile side), `TRUCHET_EXTRUDE_SHADE` (side darkness 0–1).
Animation (headless verification of motion — the loop never starts in headless;
these pin a single deterministic frame): `TRUCHET_ANIM_T` (seconds → LFO-driven
frame at that phase), `TRUCHET_ANIM_RATE` (master LFO Hz), `TRUCHET_ANIM_DEPTH`
(set all LFO depths so motion is visible), and `TRUCHET_ANIM="name=v01,..."` to
pin exact registry values (e.g. `discMod=1.0`, `rotationMod=0.85`), which also
exercises the future MIDI sink.
Image mode ("Truchet halftone" — see `ImageMode.pde`): `TRUCHET_IMG` (path to a
source image → enables image mode), `TRUCHET_IMG_COLS` (mosaic columns; rows
derived from the canvas aspect, = `gridN` in image mode), `TRUCHET_IMG_LIB`
(brightness-library size, default 256), `TRUCHET_IMG_GAMMA` (gamma on sampled
cell brightness; >1 darkens midtones), `TRUCHET_IMG_STRETCH` (0/1 = map image
brightness across the library's full achievable range, default on),
`TRUCHET_IMG_INVERT` (0/1 = invert the brightness→patch mapping),
`TRUCHET_IMG_CONTAIN` (1 = fit the whole image and pad with the bright background,
default; 0 = cover/crop to the canvas aspect). Combine with
`TRUCHET_SCHEME`/`TRUCHET_PALETTE` (brightness is measured in the active palette),
e.g. `TRUCHET_OUT=/tmp/o.png TRUCHET_IMG=/tmp/face.png TRUCHET_IMG_COLS=48`.
Use `--build` for a
quick compile check. Python+Pillow ports of the algorithm also exist for geometry checks
without Processing (`preview.png`, `trapezoid_prototype.py`). Either way, when
changing the tile geometry, render and *look* at the result rather than
assuming — the connection math is easy to get subtly wrong.

## Installing Processing in WSL (how the current install was built)

The official Processing 4 release ships only a portable `.zip` (no `.tgz` with a
prebuilt `processing-java` script anymore), so the install was assembled by hand.
To redo it:

1. **Download & extract** the latest portable build:
   ```sh
   curl -fL -o /tmp/processing.zip \
     https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/download/processing-1313-4.5.2/processing-4.5.2-linux-x64-portable.zip
   python3 -c "import zipfile; zipfile.ZipFile('/tmp/processing.zip').extractall('/tmp/px')"
   mv /tmp/px/Processing /opt/processing
   ```
   The layout is jpackage-style: runtime jars in `/opt/processing/lib/app/`, and a
   bundled Temurin 17 JDK + Processing resources (`core/`, `modes/`, `lib/`) under
   `/opt/processing/lib/app/resources/`.

2. **Restore exec bits** — Python's `zipfile` strips Unix permissions, so every
   JDK binary loses `+x`. Both `bin/` *and* `lib/` matter (`--run` spawns a child
   JVM that needs `lib/jspawnhelper`):
   ```sh
   chmod -R +x /opt/processing/lib/app/resources/jdk/bin \
               /opt/processing/lib/app/resources/jdk/lib \
               /opt/processing/bin
   ```

3. **Install X11/GL system libs** the bundled JDK's AWT needs (it touches AWT even
   on `--build`):
   ```sh
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y libxtst6 libxrender1 libxext6 libxi6 \
     libxxf86vm1 libxrandr2 libxcursor1 libxinerama1 libfreetype6 fontconfig \
     libgl1 libglu1-mesa
   ```

4. **Create the `processing-java` wrapper** (the portable zip omits it). The key
   flag is `-Dcompose.application.resources.dir=.../resources` — without it
   Processing can't locate its home folder and reports "The package processing
   does not exist". File `/opt/processing/processing-java`:
   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh
   PROC_HOME=/opt/processing
   JAVA="$PROC_HOME/lib/app/resources/jdk/bin/java"
   APPLIB="$PROC_HOME/lib/app"
   exec "$JAVA" \
     -Djna.nosys=true \
     -Dcompose.application.resources.dir="$APPLIB/resources" \
     -Dskiko.library.path="$APPLIB" \
     -Djava.awt.headless=false \
     -cp "$APPLIB/*" \
     processing.mode.java.Commander "$@"
   ```
   Then put both commands on the PATH:
   ```sh
   chmod +x /opt/processing/processing-java
   ln -sf /opt/processing/processing-java /usr/local/bin/processing-java
   ln -sf /opt/processing/bin/Processing   /usr/local/bin/processing
   ```

5. **Verify:** `processing-java --sketch=/mnt/e/Multiscale_Truchet --build`
   should print `Finished.`

## The one thing to understand before editing tile geometry

Multi-scale connection depends entirely on a single invariant: **wherever a band
crosses a tile edge, the black/white boundary meets that edge at the 1/3 and 2/3
points**, with the band occupying the central third (width `s/3`).

This is what lets tiles of different sizes abut seamlessly: a size-`S` tile's
edge crossings sit at `S/3` and `2S/3`; the two size-`S/2` tiles along that same
edge cross at `S/6, S/3` and `2S/3, 5S/6` — so `S/3` and `2S/3` are shared
exactly and the curves join. Corner arcs therefore use **radius `s/2` with stroke
weight `s/3`** (centred stroke → inner radius `s/3`, outer `2s/3`), and
`strokeCap(SQUARE)` so band ends lie flush along the edge. Any change to these
ratios breaks cross-scale connectivity.

**Colours invert every scale level** (`depth % 2` in `drawTile`) for contrast.

**Winged tiles** (`winged`, default on) are what make connection *structural*
rather than reliant on colour inversion: every tile gets a background disc at
each corner (radius `s/3`) and a foreground disc at each edge midpoint (radius
`s/6`), drawn **unclipped** so they spill into neighbours. A coarse edge's
midpoint is the shared corner of the two half-size tiles along it, so the discs
coincide and join the scales. This requires drawing **coarse-first** (the
`for depth` loop over collected `leaves` in `draw()`), so finer tiles sit on top
— Carlson's "smaller tiles on top of larger". Do not revert to drawing during
recursion; that breaks the layering. These constants (`s/3`, `s/6`) mirror
Steele's `lineWidth` and `lineWidth/2`.

The same invariant generalizes to n-gons (band width = `side/3`; arc radius from
the edge-line intersection). A **whole hexagon tile skips wings** (`winged && n !=
6` in `drawPolyTile`) and uses fully-connected tiles — the classic arc-at-midpoint
connection. Hexagons get multi-scale by **subdividing into 6 equilateral
triangles** (a hexagon is not a rep-tile; see `children()`); those triangles *do*
use wings. So hexagon mode mixes whole-hexagon tiles (coarse) with winged triangle
detail (finer).

**Seams / antialiasing.** Each tile's bands are stroked as ONE Java2D path
(`drawTileBands`), so a tile's own bands union into a single antialiased shape (no
1px gaps between separately-drawn strokes). Whole hexagons have no wings to bridge
*inter*-tile joins, so **all hexagon bands are batched into one path and stroked
once** (`strokeHexBatch`, called from `draw()` after the depth-0 pass) — the whole
hexagon layer is a single AA shape, eliminating seams between tiles. They share
one colour at depth 0 (the per-tile `gradient` scheme, mode 2, is the exception
and falls back to per-tile via `colorScheme != 2` in `drawPolyTile`). Hexagon
bands use a `ROUND` cap so they overlap smoothly across edges. Square/triangle
keep per-tile clip + wings, which hide their joins.

**Gotcha — `arc()` honours `ellipseMode`.** The tile arcs call
`arc(cx, cy, 2*r, 2*r, ...)` assuming the default `CENTER` mode (args = width/
height). So never leave `ellipseMode(RADIUS)` set: the wing discs are therefore
drawn in `CENTER` mode using *diameters*, not `RADIUS`. A stray
`ellipseMode(RADIUS)` makes every subsequent `arc()` read its diameter as a
radius — doubling the arcs into a chunky mess on the next shape/frame. This was
the actual cause of the "hexagon looks broken after switching shapes" bug (not
the grid — the hex grid is a correct staggered tessellation).

## Structure of the sketch

The `.pde` tabs are merged into one PApplet:

- **`Multiscale_Truchet.pde`** — globals, `setup()`/`draw()`, colour, keys.
  `draw()` calls `buildRoots()`, recursively `collectTile()`s into the global
  `ArrayList<Tile> leaves`, then draws **coarse-first** (loop over depth) — the
  layering winged tiles depend on. `collectTile()` either subdivides
  (`canSubdivide()` && `random < subdivideProb`) or records a leaf. Do not draw
  during recursion; it breaks the coarse-first layering. The coarse-first draw
  loop is factored into `renderTiling()` (operates on the global `leaves`) so
  image mode can reuse it for both its calibration rounds and the final mosaic;
  `draw()` either takes the image-mode branch (`drawImageMode()`) or the normal
  background → `rebuildLeaves()` → `renderTiling()` → `applySymmetry()` path.
  **Drop shadows** render each depth level in three passes — all backgrounds,
  then ONE unioned shadow mask (every caster offset by `shadowSize·side/3` along
  `shadowAngle`, drawn opaque into an offscreen `BufferedImage`, composited once
  at `shadowStrength`), then all foregrounds — so a shadow sits above its level's
  backgrounds and below its bands with a single light direction, and same-level
  shadows never double-darken (one mask). `shadowGlobal` (default off, toggle in
  Controls) switches to ONE full-scene mask drawn after *all* backgrounds: coarse
  tiles then cast across finer regions, at the cost of the per-level cue that
  finer backgrounds occlude the coarser shadow beneath them. Shadow size scales
  with `side`, so finer tiles cast proportionally finer shadows automatically.
  **3D extrusion** (`extrude3D`, keys `e`/`E`, Controls toggle + mode button) is
  a graffiti block-depth effect: the foreground ribbons gain solid side walls
  extruded toward a vanishing point, viewed head-on (the tiling is NOT
  perspective-warped). Reuses the shadow's offscreen-layer idea. When on, `draw()`
  takes a separate branch: **all** backgrounds first (so a finer tile's background
  can never chop a coarser ribbon's wall), then the optional drop shadow on that
  flat plane, then per level coarse-first it calls `drawExtrudeLevel(d)` (build +
  composite that level's walls) and draws the level's top faces on top — so finer
  walls/faces land over coarser (Carlson's "smaller on top"). `drawExtrudeLevel`
  builds the level's silhouette (band path + wing nubs) once, then re-draws it as
  many overlapping "slices" stepping toward the VP into one ARGB `extrudeLayer`
  (separate from `shadowLayer`): **oblique** translates each slice in parallel
  (direction = canvas-centre→VP); **1-point** scales each slice about the VP
  (`AffineTransform`, converging + thinner at the back). Every slice is the SAME
  flat `sideColor()` (darkened palette `darkest()`), so the stack unions into one
  clean wall with no internal seam (same-colour-over-same-colour), composited
  once. Vector re-draw (not raster rescale) keeps the thin `side/3`/`side/6`
  features crisp at every depth. Depth scales with the level's `side` (coarse
  ribbons extrude deeper). Hex bands must be stroked by the body builder itself
  (the `hexBatch` is top-face-only). Slice count N is derived from screen-space
  travel and clamped (≤1200) so a near VP in 1-point can't explode it. Gated:
  with `extrude3D` off, `draw()` is byte-for-byte the original path.
- **`Shapes.pde`** — the generalized n-gon engine, added when triangle/hexagon
  support landed. A `Tile` is `(cx, cy, R, rot, n, depth)`. `shapeMode`
  (0/1/2/3 → square/triangle/hexagon/trapezoid, keys 4/3/6/t) drives `buildRoots()`
  (`squareRoots`/`triangleRoots`/`hexagonRoots`/`trapezoidRoots`) and `children()` (square
  quadtree; triangle rep-tile = 3 corner + 1 flipped medial; hexagon = 6
  equilateral triangles fanning from the centre, which then recurse as n==3 —
  `canSubdivide` is just `depth < maxDepth`). `drawPolyTile()` draws one
  tile: a connection between edges `i,j` is a straight band if opposite
  (`min(|i−j|, n−|i−j|) == n/2`), else an arc whose centre is `lineIntersect()`
  of the two edge lines (radius = midpoint→centre). Band width `side/3`. The
  motif (alphabet index `mi` + rotation steps `mk`, chosen in `collectTile()` so
  rot-180 twins can share it) rotates by `rot + mk·(2π/n)`, which keeps the
  footprint (so it still tiles) and just relabels edges. Square/triangle **clip the motif to the tile
  polygon** as a safety net (`pushPolyClip`/`popPolyClip`, which reach the JAVA2D
  `Graphics2D` since Processing's `clip()` is rectangle-only); wings draw after
  the clip is released so they still spill. Hexagons skip the clip and use
  `ROUND` stroke caps so bands overlap across shared edges (closing the AA seam
  that wings hide on the other shapes).
  - **Trapezoid** (`shapeMode == 3`, the **half-hexagon**, ported from
    `trapezoid_prototype.py`) is the one shape that is *not* a regular n-gon, so it
    bypasses the `(cx,cy,R,rot,n)` vertex math: a trapezoid `Tile` carries a complex
    **similarity** `(p0, e)` in a y-up *canonical* frame (`world(z) = p0 + z·e`; the
    canonical unit tile has short edge 1, long edge 2, height √3/2 — see `TRAP_V`),
    flagged `Tile.trap`, with `cx/cy` holding the screen centroid and `n` left at 4
    (the polygon vertex count, for bg fill + clip). Its long edge carries **two
    ports** (5 ports total: `TRAP_PORT` = B1,B2,R,T,L), so 5 is odd and one port is
    always unmatched — the fg wing nub caps it. All six connections are circular
    **arcs** with explicit canonical centres (`trapArcSpec`, centres lie on both
    ports' edge lines → perpendicular crossings, width 1/3); the L–R "sweep" centres
    on the cut-off apex. `trapezoidRoots()` lays the staggered up/down lattice
    (`e = ±1`). **Subdivision is lattice-preserving** (`children()`): a half-hexagon
    trapezoid is exactly **3 unit equilateral triangles** (`TRAP_TRIS`, two up + one
    down), so it splits into those — transformed to screen via `(p0,e)` and recorded
    as `n==3` tiles, which then recurse with the triangle rep-tile rule (the same
    strategy the hexagon uses; whole trapezoids stay the coarse scale, finer detail
    is triangular). The 3 triangles' boundary edges reproduce the trapezoid's exact
    port lattice — the long edge = the two up-triangles' bases (2 ports), the top
    edge = the down-triangle's base (1), each leg = one triangle edge (1) — so a
    whole trapezoid and a subdivided one connect seamlessly, giving the classical
    continuous multi-scale pattern. (An earlier rep-4 split into 4 rotated
    half-trapezoids would have moved the children's ports off the connection lattice;
    it also never ran, because a trapezoid has `n==4` and was caught by the square
    quadtree branch — `children()` now tests `t.trap` **before** `t.n`.)
    `TileGeom.initTrap()` builds the *whole-trapezoid* screen geometry and exposes
    the *shape-neutral* interface every render pass reads: `vx/vy` (outline),
    `bgWx/bgWy` + `fgWx/fgWy` (wing-disc centres — 5 corners / 5 ports for the
    trapezoid, vertices / edge midpoints for regular shapes), `wings`, `side`, and
    `appendBands()` (centre-lines: `appendConn` for regular, `appendTrapConn` for the
    trapezoid). It uses the same `side/3` clip + wings path as square/triangle. The
    structural symmetry modes (4–7, grid-specific) are skipped for it
    (`rebuildLeaves`); pixel mirrors (1–3) still apply. Whole-trapezoid tile weights
    live in `TRAP_W` (not `weightsFor(n)`, which would alias the square); subdivided
    detail uses the triangle alphabet (`TRI_CONNS`/`TRI_W`).
- **`Palettes.pde`** — `PaletteManager`/`Palette`; colour source. `colorScheme`
  (`schemeName`) selects one of four: duotone (lightest/darkest, inverted per
  level), multi (`ribbonColor()`: light ground, one palette colour per level),
  gradient (`gradientColor`: one random solid ground colour, bands sample a
  random-direction gradient of the other colours, one flat colour per tile),
  gradient-bg (a *smooth* full-canvas gradient, solid ribbons; `drawPolyTile`
  skips the bg polygon when `colorScheme==3` so the gradient shows through), or
  gradient-smooth (solid ground, ribbons painted with the smooth gradient
  continuously). The gradient family shares `setupGradient()`, which also builds
  a Java2D `LinearGradientPaint` (`gradPaint`) matching `gradientColor`'s
  projection; schemes 3 and 4 use it via `g2` (`drawGradientBackground` fills the
  canvas; `gradientStroke()`/`drawTileBands`/`fillDiscG2` stroke the bands and wing
  discs). `tileFg`/`tileBg` take the `Tile` (gradient needs position). Keys
  `p`/`P` palettes, `R` rotate palette colour order (`Palette.rotate`), `C`
  scheme. There is no `cDark`/`cLight`. The gradient schemes pick via `random()`,
  so `draw()` re-seeds (`randomSeed(seedVal)`) after `setupGradient()` to keep the
  tile layout identical across schemes. `loadDefaults()` seeds **45** palettes
  from the COLOURlovers all-time most-loved list (hex verified against two
  verbatim top-100 dumps); `loadFromColourLovers()` can still refresh live but is
  Cloudflare-blocked in practice. To bake in more, add `fromHex(...)` lines there.
- **`ControlWindow.pde`** — a second PApplet (own window, launched in `setup()`
  via `runSketch`) with immediate-mode sliders/buttons writing straight to the
  main sketch's globals (`parent.*`) and calling `parent.redraw()`. If you add a
  tunable global, add a widget here too. The bottom **Image mode** section
  (img cols/lib/gamma sliders, image/stretch/invert toggles, a `selectInput`
  "Load image…" button) drives the Truchet halftone; its widgets set `imgDirty`.
- **`TileWindow.pde`** — a third PApplet window listing the active shape's tile
  **archetypes** (`parent.connsFor(n)`, or `parent.TRAP_CONNS` for the trapezoid —
  base connection sets, no rotations) with a slider per archetype that writes its
  selection weight into `parent.weightsFor(n)` / `parent.TRAP_W` (the same
  `TILE_W`/`TRI_W`/`HEX_W`/`TRAP_W` `pickWeighted` reads) and calls
  `parent.redraw()`. It draws each archetype with its own `drawArchetype()` (a
  compact copy of the band geometry, using `parent.lineIntersect`) — or
  `drawTrapArchetype()` (sampling `parent.trapArcSpec`) for the trapezoid — since
  drawing must target *this* window's canvas, not the main one. It reads
  `parent.shapeMode` each frame, so it relists automatically when the shape changes
  (the window is sized tall enough for the trapezoid's 8 archetypes).
- **`Animation.pde`** — the animation engine. The tile layout is stable per seed,
  so animation never rebuilds tiles: it modulates *render-time* geometry. A small
  registry (`AnimState anim`, normalized `volatile` `-1..+1` values:
  `bandWidthMod/discMod/rotationMod/arcSweepMod/arcRadiusMod/colorMod`) is the
  single sink — `setAnimValue(name, v01)` is the **thread-safe MIDI seam** a future
  Windows-host `javax.sound.midi` handler will write to. For now per-target `Lfo`s
  on a deterministic clock (`animSeconds`) drive it (`driveAnimFromLFOs`,
  `animSource == 0`). `draw()` calls `updateAnim()` once at the top, which advances
  the clock and writes the read-only frame-globals (`animBandScale`, `animDiscScale`,
  `animArcSweep`, `animArcRadius`, `animRotOffset`) the render passes multiply into
  the `side/3` strokes, disc radii, arc `r`/`diff`, and `TileGeom` rotation. When
  animation is off these are identity, so a static frame is byte-identical to before.
  `setAnimEnabled()` flips `noLoop()` ↔ `loop()`. **Connection-safe** modulators:
  `discMod` (and `colorMod`, reserved). **Connection-breaking** (intentional, the
  expressive set): `bandWidthMod`, `arcSweepMod`, `arcRadiusMod`, `rotationMod` —
  they move band edge-crossings off the 1/3–2/3 points so ribbons no longer meet at
  edges. Controls default the safe channel on, breaking ones at depth 0 (labelled
  `*` in the panel).
- **`ImageMode.pde`** — **Truchet halftone**: render a source image as a mosaic of
  multi-scale Truchet patches chosen by brightness (ASCII-art, but the "glyphs"
  are little tilings). Two phases, both reusing `collectTile` + `renderTiling`:
  **(1) calibration** (`buildLibrary`) generates `libSize` candidate patches —
  each one square cell subdivided from its own RNG seed (`collectPatch` pins the
  seed *and* `subdivideProb`, which is swept across `[0,1]` so the library spans
  sparse/bright → dense/dark) — renders them batched on the canvas and reads back
  each one's mean luminance via `loadPixels()` (ignoring a guard ring to avoid
  neighbour wing-spill); **(2) compose** (`buildMosaic`) lays the square grid
  (`gridN = imgCols`), area-samples the image per cell (`sampleGrid` cover-crops to
  the grid aspect), and places the patch whose measured brightness best matches
  (`sortLibrary` + `pickPatch`, nearest among K by a position hash so equal cells
  don't all repeat one patch), then renders the whole mosaic. Brightness is read
  off the *rendered* pixels in the active palette, so the mapping is faithful to
  any colour scheme (duotone reads cleanest). On load, `flattenOntoWhite()`
  composites any transparency onto white — **essential for logo/SVG PNGs**, whose
  transparent background is stored as RGB (0,0,0), identical to a black foreground,
  so without it the whole image samples as uniform black and collapses to one
  repeated patch. `sampleGrid` reduces the image to the cell grid in one of two
  fit modes (`imgContain`: contain + pad with the bright bg, default, nothing
  cropped — good for logos; else cover/crop — good for photos). Cached via
  `imgDirty`: rebuilt only
  when the image, mapping params, palette/scheme, or any patch-appearance global
  (depth, subdiv, winged, invert) changes. `imageChosen()` is the Controls
  "Load image…" `selectInput` callback. **The patch's intrinsic brightness is
  measured in isolation; the final mosaic adds a little uniform darkening from
  neighbours' overlapping wings — acceptable, and the histogram-stretch + nearest
  match absorb it. If you change tile geometry/colour, the library must be
  remeasured (it is, on `imgDirty`).**
- **Layout caching** (main tab): `leaves`/gradient are rebuilt only when
  `dirtyLayout`/`dirtyGradient` are set (in `rebuildLeaves`/`setupGradient` guards),
  not every animated frame. Every layout-affecting mutator (seed, grid, depth,
  subdiv, shape, symmetry, tile weights) sets `dirtyLayout`; palette/scheme set
  `dirtyGradient`; image-mode mutators set `imgDirty`. If you add a mutator that
  changes the tiling or colours, set the matching flag or the change won't show
  while animating.

Per-shape alphabets: `TILE_CONNS`/`TILE_W` (square, in the main tab), `TRI_CONNS`
(triangle: blank + single arc — one port per edge allows at most one arc),
`HEX_CONNS` (whole-hexagon tiles: fully-connected matchings only — including
distance-2 "sweeping" arcs; a subdivided hexagon becomes triangles and uses
`TRI_CONNS`), and `TRAP_CONNS`/`TRAP_W` (trapezoid: 8 motifs over its **5 ports**,
indices into `TRAP_PORT`, not edges). `connsFor(n)`/`weightsFor(n)` pick the right
one for the regular shapes; the trapezoid is keyed on `Tile.trap` instead (its `n`
is 4 and would otherwise alias the square), so `collectTile`, `TileGeom`, and the
panels branch on `trap`/`shapeMode == 3` to reach `TRAP_CONNS`/`TRAP_W`.

## Multi-window architecture (control panels)

The GUI panels are **separate `PApplet`s**, not a GUI library. Processing
supports multiple windows by running additional `PApplet` instances; the main
sketch's `setup()` launches each with
`PApplet.runSketch(new String[]{"..."}, win)` and hands it a `parent`
reference back to the main sketch (currently two: `ControlWindow` and
`TileWindow`). Widgets are drawn immediate-mode (custom sliders/toggles/buttons)
— no G4P/ControlP5 dependency. The points below say "control window" but apply to
both panels.

Gotchas that matter when editing this:

- **`size()` must be in `ControlWindow.settings()`**, not `setup()`. The Processing
  preprocessor only auto-relocates `size()` for the main tab; a `PApplet`
  subclass must declare it in `settings()` or the window won't size correctly.
- **Two animation threads.** The control window runs its own draw loop; the
  visualization is `noLoop()`. Widgets write to `parent.*` globals and then call
  `parent.redraw()` to repaint the viz. Reads of `parent` state for *display*
  (palette name, swatches, current shape/scheme) are best-effort cross-thread —
  fine for a control panel, but don't build logic that assumes atomicity.
- **Save goes through a flag, not a direct call.** The Save button sets
  `parent.saveRequested = true` and calls `redraw()`; the actual `saveFrame()`
  runs at the end of the viz's `draw()` (step 3). This guarantees the saved PNG
  is the fully-drawn frame and avoids grabbing the pixel buffer from the wrong
  thread mid-render.
- **Keep widgets in sync with globals.** `syncParent()` maps sliders/toggles onto
  `parent.gridN/maxDepth/subdivideProb/winged/invertPerLevel` by index/field; the
  shape/scheme/palette buttons call the same mutators the keyboard does. If you
  add a tunable global, add a widget here and extend `syncParent()` (or its
  button handler) too, or the panel and keys will drift out of agreement.

  Tiles"* (Bridges 2020): the "two points per side at thirds / four arcs per
  tile" generalization this sketch's geometry builds on.
- Oliver Steele, *"Generalized Truchet Tiles"*
  (https://observablehq.com/@osteele/truchet-tile-generation): source of the
  edge-pair tile representation. It generalizes to n-gons (the arc centre is the
  intersection of the two edge lines; for squares that is the shared corner,
  radius = half-side — matching this sketch). It is single-scale; the
  quadtree + colour-inversion multi-scale logic here is the Carlson part.
- Carlson's multi-scale post (linked in the sketch header) is the target aesthetic.
